# zac
A website for an imaginary shop called ZAC (carefully named after the 3 self-obsessed developers of this project) developed using PHP. Feel free to download the project and see our work in action. Order as many of our products (why not order when it's free?), add products if you want to too using the Admin account.
Make sure to download the zac.sql database file and import it in your MySql database. If you do not use the default host "127.0.0.1" and port "3360" you might want to make changes in the files "order_db_access","product_db_access" and "user_db_access" placed in the folder "zac/data", otherwise the project will not work properly.
