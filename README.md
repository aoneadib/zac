# zac
A website for an imaginary shop called ZAC developed using PHP. Feel free to download the project and see our work in action. Order as many of our products (why not order when it's free?), add products if you want to using the Admin account. You can signup as a customer and start ordering. If you signup as an accountant or salesman, you have to first get the created account verified by the admin for access. To verify an accountant/salesman's account, login as the admin using the email and password provided below and make the account status "Valid". Voila! Now you can access as an accountant/salesman.
Make sure to download the zac.sql database file and import it in your MySql database. If you do not use the default host "127.0.0.1" and port "3360" you might want to make changes in the files "order_db_access","product_db_access" and "user_db_access" placed in the folder "zac/data", otherwise the project will not work properly.
